# TypeScript
TypeScript is a language created by Microsoft and released under an open-source Apache 2.0 License (2004). The 
language is focused on making the development of JavaScript programs scale to many thousands of lines of code. 
The language attacks the large-scale JavaScript programming problem by offering better design-time tooling, 
compile-time checking, and dynamic module loading at runtime.
